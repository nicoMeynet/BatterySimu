## 1. Objective
This report evaluates multiple residential battery storage configurations in order to:
- Identify the optimal storage capacity for the household
- Quantify financial impact versus a no-battery baseline
- Detect structural undersizing or oversizing conditions
- Assess seasonal robustness and power limitations
- Support an investment decision based on measurable indicators
The goal is to select the smallest battery configuration that provides strong financial and operational performance without structural limitations.

## 2. What This Report Covers
This report includes:
- Monthly and seasonal energy behavior analysis
- Financial gain comparison versus no battery
- Grid import and export reduction metrics
- Battery utilization indicators (cycles, throughput, activity duration)
- Energy saturation indicators (battery full / empty share)
- Structural undersizing metrics (daily and evening)
- Power saturation indicators (active and idle constraints)
All results are derived from simulation based on real household load measurements and applied tariff rules.

## 3. What This Report Does Not Cover
This report does not include:
- Hardware degradation modeling beyond maximum cycle assumptions
- Future tariff changes or regulatory impacts
- Dynamic market price arbitrage
- Backup power reliability analysis
- Installation costs or electrical infrastructure upgrades
- Financing structure or tax optimization
The analysis is strictly based on operational performance and direct tariff-based financial impact.

## 4. Target Audience
This report is intended for:
- Homeowners evaluating battery investments
- Energy optimization enthusiasts
- Technical decision makers
- Financial decision makers assessing ROI
- System designers reviewing sizing trade-offs
The document is structured to support both technical and business-level evaluation.
