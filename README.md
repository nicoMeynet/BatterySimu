# Battery Simulator

This Python script simulates the behavior of a battery system in a three-phase setup. It analyzes solar energy production, house consumption, and battery behavior to estimate energy flow, battery usage, and potential savings.

## Features

- Simulates charging and discharging of a battery system based on solar production and house consumption.
- Calculates energy injected into or consumed from the grid.
- Supports three-phase energy systems.
- Interpolates missing data points for consistent analysis.
- Provides insights into battery lifespan and energy costs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `tabulate`
