# Battery Simulator

## Overview
The Battery Simulator is a Python-based tool designed to optimize residential energy consumption using a 3-phase battery system. By modeling battery behavior and calculating energy flows, the simulator provides insights into energy usage, cost savings, and the financial viability of battery systems in real-world scenarios. This tool empowers homeowners to make data-driven decisions about integrating battery systems into their energy setups, including determining the optimal sizing of the system, the number of batteries per phase, and the charging and discharging power required per phase.

Key benefits include:
- **Technical:** Simulates energy flows and battery performance with precision.
- **Financial:** Provides detailed analysis of cost savings and rentability.
- **Operational:** Easily integrates with Home Assistant CSV data for seamless modeling.

### Why Plug-and-Play Batteries?
In recent years, plug-and-play battery systems have surged in popularity due to their ease of installationâ€”no electrician required. Technological advancements and decreasing costs have made these systems more accessible for residential use. However, understanding their economic feasibility remains challenging.

#### Examples of plug-and-play batteries:
- **Zendure Hyper 2000:** Known for its portability and user-friendly setup.
- **Sunology Storey:** Offers scalability and efficient energy storage for small households.

The Battery Simulator aims to simplify this evaluation process by analyzing the potential savings, operational impact, and optimal configuration of these systems.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `tabulate`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas tabulate
```

## Usage
Run the script with the following command:
```bash
python battery_simulator.py <house_phase_a.csv> <house_phase_b.csv> <house_phase_c.csv>
```

### Arguments
- `<house_phase_a.csv>`: CSV file containing energy consumption data for Phase A.
- `<house_phase_b.csv>`: CSV file containing energy consumption data for Phase B.
- `<house_phase_c.csv>`: CSV file containing energy consumption data for Phase C.

### Example
```bash
python battery_simulator.py phase_a.csv phase_b.csv phase_c.csv

```

## Input File Format
The CSV file containing the measurements is sourced from Home Assistant, which collects energy consumption data for each phase using a Shelly 3EM module.
Each input CSV file should have the following structure:

### Phase CSV (A, B, C)
| entity_id                                    | state       | last_changed           |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| sensor.shellyem3_244cab435bf4_channel_a_power | 128.517028  | 2024-12-31T23:00:00Z |
| sensor.shellyem3_244cab435bf4_channel_a_power | 128.570356  | 2025-01-01T00:00:00Z |

### Preprocessing
The script performs the following preprocessing steps:
- Cleans and renames columns.
- Groups data by timestamp.
- Fills missing timestamps with interpolated values.

## Outputs
1. **Simulation Results**: Detailed energy statistics printed to the console, including:
   - Energy injected and consumed during peak (HP) and off-peak (HC) hours.
   - Delta values for energy usage and associated cost differences.
   - Rentability of the battery
   - Battery lifecycle statistics.
