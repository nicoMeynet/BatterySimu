# Battery Simulator

## Overview
This project is a Python-based battery simulator that models the behavior of a 3-phase battery system in a residential setup. It calculates energy usage, solar production, and battery behavior to optimize energy consumption and reduce costs. The simulation includes:

- Handling of solar energy consumption.
- Tracking battery charge and discharge cycles.
- Integration of time-of-use tariffs (peak and off-peak hours).
- Simulation of energy injected into or consumed from the grid.

In recent years, plugin battery systems have become increasingly popular due to their ease of installationâ€”requiring no electrician for setup. However, evaluating whether these systems are economically beneficial remains a challenge. The goal of this script is to help users make informed decisions by simulating and analyzing the financial impact of such systems.

Example of plug and play battery: Zendure hyper 2000

## Features
- Models a 3-phase battery system with configurable capacity and power.
- Calculates battery efficiency and lifecycle.
- Handles time-based tariffs for energy consumption and injection.
- Provides detailed statistics on energy usage and battery behavior.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `tabulate`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas tabulate
```

## Usage
Run the script with the following command:
```bash
python battery_simulator.py <house_phase_a.csv> <house_phase_b.csv> <house_phase_c.csv>
```

### Arguments
- `<house_phase_a.csv>`: CSV file containing energy consumption data for Phase A.
- `<house_phase_b.csv>`: CSV file containing energy consumption data for Phase B.
- `<house_phase_c.csv>`: CSV file containing energy consumption data for Phase C.

### Example
```bash
python battery_simulator.py phase_a.csv phase_b.csv phase_c.csv

```

## Input File Format
The CSV file containing the measurements is sourced from Home Assistant, which collects energy consumption data for each phase using a Shelly 3EM module.
Each input CSV file should have the following structure:

### Phase CSV (A, B, C)
| entity_id                                    | state       | last_changed           |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| sensor.shellyem3_244cab435bf4_channel_a_power | 128.517028  | 2024-12-31T23:00:00Z |
| sensor.shellyem3_244cab435bf4_channel_a_power | 128.570356  | 2025-01-01T00:00:00Z |

### Preprocessing
The script performs the following preprocessing steps:
- Cleans and renames columns.
- Groups data by timestamp.
- Fills missing timestamps with interpolated values.

## Outputs
1. **Simulation Results**: Detailed energy statistics printed to the console, including:
   - Energy injected and consumed during peak (HP) and off-peak (HC) hours.
   - Delta values for energy usage and associated cost differences.
   - Rentability of the battery
   - Battery lifecycle statistics.
